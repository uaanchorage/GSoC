## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

Get oriented with the essentials:

- [ ] **Understand the context**: Read the [Land Acknowledgements](Land-Acknowledgements.md) to learn about Alaska's Indigenous heritage and our commitment to respectful collaboration
- [ ] **Review AI policy**: Check the [Acceptable and Ethical AI Use Policy](Acceptable-and-Ethical-AI-Use-Policy.md) to understand acceptable use of AI tools like ChatGPT
- [ ] **Browse projects**: Scan through the 10 project ideas in the [README](README.md) and note 2-3 that match your skills and interests
- [ ] **Star and watch**: Star this repository and click "Watch" to get notifications about updates
- [ ] **Check requirements**: Note each project's required skills, difficulty level, and time commitment (90/175/350 hours)

## 📋 First Week Actions

Start building your application foundation:

### 1. Join Discussion Forums
- Navigate to your chosen project's discussion forum (links are in each project description)
- Read through existing discussions to understand common questions and mentor expectations
- Look for pinned posts or FAQs specific to that project

### 2. Introduce Yourself
Post an introduction in the discussion forum including:
- Your name and location (including timezone)
- Educational background and current status (student, graduate, etc.)
- Relevant experience (courses, projects, internships)
- Why you're interested in this specific project
- What you hope to learn

**Example Introduction:**
```
Hi! I'm Jane Doe from India (UTC+5:30). I'm a final-year Computer Science student 
with experience in Python and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in 
Project #3 (Alaska Wildfire Prediction) because I've worked with satellite imagery 
processing in my coursework and I'm passionate about climate change solutions. 
I'm excited to contribute to research that helps protect Alaskan communities.
```

### 3. Complete the Code Challenge
- Each project has a specific code challenge listed
- Create a GitHub repository with your solution
- Write a clear README.md explaining:
  - What the challenge asked you to do
  - Your approach and design decisions
  - How to run your code
  - Any challenges you faced and how you solved them
- Share the repository link in the discussion forum

### 4. Ask Meaningful Questions
- Avoid questions answered in the documentation
- Ask about project scope, technical approaches, or implementation details
- Example good questions:
  - "For Project #3, would you prefer TensorFlow or PyTorch for the model implementation?"
  - "Should the coastline extraction tool prioritize accuracy or processing speed?"
  - "What format do you envision for the final deliverables?"

### 5. Research the Project Deeply
- Read the linked source code repositories
- Review any related research papers mentioned
- Check the project's issue tracker for current challenges
- Look at past GSoC reports if available (check for GSoC-2024, GSoC-2025 tags)

## 🎯 Application Preparation (Weeks 2-3)

Build a strong proposal:

### 1. Study the Evaluation Criteria
Read the [Rubrics](Rubrics.md) carefully. Your proposal will be evaluated on:
- Technical approach and feasibility
- Understanding of the project
- Clarity of communication
- Relevant experience and skills
- Timeline and milestones
- Commitment and motivation

### 2. Draft Your Proposal
Use the template provided in [CONTRIBUTOR-GUIDE.md](CONTRIBUTOR-GUIDE.md). Your proposal should include:

**Essential Sections:**
- **Project Title and Overview**: Concise summary of what you'll build
- **Personal Information**: Name, contact, timezone, university
- **Background**: Relevant skills, courses, and projects with links to your code
- **Project Understanding**: Demonstrate deep understanding of the problem
- **Technical Approach**: Detailed implementation plan with specific technologies
- **Timeline**: Week-by-week breakdown with concrete deliverables
- **Expected Outcomes**: What will be delivered at the end
- **Why You**: What makes you the right person for this project
- **Availability**: Confirm you can commit the required hours

**Pro Tips:**
- Be specific: Instead of "implement machine learning," say "implement a CNN-LSTM model using PyTorch 2.0"
- Include diagrams or architecture drawings where appropriate
- Reference specific functions, libraries, or approaches
- Show you've read the existing codebase by mentioning specific files or classes

### 3. Get Feedback Early
- Post your draft proposal to the discussion forum **at least 2 weeks before the deadline**
- Ask specific questions: "Does my timeline seem realistic for the 350-hour scope?"
- Be open to criticism and iterate based on mentor feedback
- Address ALL feedback in subsequent versions

### 4. Polish Your Application
- Proofread carefully for grammar and spelling
- Ensure all links work
- Format consistently using Markdown
- Include a table of contents for longer proposals
- Add your GitHub profile, LinkedIn (if relevant), and portfolio

### 5. Submit Before Deadline
- Don't wait until the last minute
- Submit through the official GSoC website (not just the GitHub discussion)
- Keep a copy of your submitted proposal
- Confirm submission was successful

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Communication Best Practices
- ❌ **Don't**: Send private emails or social media messages to mentors
- ✅ **Do**: Use public discussion forums for all communication
- ❌ **Don't**: Ask "Can I work on this project?" (everyone can apply!)
- ✅ **Do**: Show you're already working on it through code challenges and discussions

### Demonstrating Skills
- **Show, don't tell**: Link to GitHub repositories, not just list skills
- **Quality over quantity**: One well-documented project beats ten undocumented ones
- **Code samples matter**: Clean, commented code demonstrates professionalism
- **Contributions count**: Prior open-source contributions (even small ones) are valuable

### Standing Out
- **Be specific**: Use technical terms correctly and reference specific parts of the codebase
- **Show initiative**: Identify potential improvements or challenges not explicitly mentioned
- **Engage authentically**: Thoughtful questions and responses matter more than frequent shallow posts
- **Demonstrate research**: Reference relevant papers, libraries, or similar projects
- **Be professional**: Treat this as a job application because it essentially is one

### Time Management
- Start early (ideally 4-6 weeks before deadline)
- Spend more time understanding than writing
- Budget time for multiple proposal iterations
- Don't apply to more projects than you can research thoroughly

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Generic proposals that could apply to any project
- ❌ Unrealistic timelines (claiming you'll do in 1 week what typically takes 1 month)
- ❌ Ignoring the code challenge
- ❌ Not reading existing documentation before asking questions
- ❌ Using AI-generated content without understanding it (see [AI Use Policy](Acceptable-and-Ethical-AI-Use-Policy.md))
- ❌ Applying to multiple projects with copy-pasted proposals
- ❌ Promising features beyond the project scope without justification

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If You're Stuck:
1. **Check the FAQ first**: [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) probably has your answer
2. **Search discussions**: Others may have asked the same question
3. **Post in the forum**: Ask clear, specific questions with context
4. **Be patient**: Mentors are volunteers and may take 24-48 hours to respond

### What to Do If:
- **Your code challenge isn't working**: Share your repository and describe what you've tried
- **You don't understand a requirement**: Ask for clarification with specific examples
- **You're unsure about scope**: Propose your interpretation and ask for validation
- **You have multiple project ideas**: Focus on one for your main proposal, mention others as alternatives
