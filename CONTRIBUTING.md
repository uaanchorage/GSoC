## Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Contribute
- **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
- **Start small** - fix typos, improve documentation, or tackle "good first issue" labels
- **Understand the impact** - ensure your contribution adds real value

### Pull Request Best Practices
- **Keep changes focused** - one logical change per PR
- **Write clear commit messages** - explain what and why, not just what
- **Test your changes** - ensure nothing breaks
- **Follow existing code style** and documentation patterns

### Communication Guidelines
- **Use GitHub discussions** for project-related questions
- **Be specific** in your questions - include error messages, code snippets, or specific challenges
- **Avoid AI-generated content** that you don't understand (see our AI policy)
- **Be patient** - mentors volunteer their time and may not respond immediately

## Getting Help

### For Technical Issues
- Check project-specific documentation and issue trackers
